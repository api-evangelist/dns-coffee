      DNS Coffee collects, analyzes, and archives changes to root zone files
      provided by various top-level domains (TLDs), offering one of the most
      comprehensive views of the current state of the Domain Name System (DNS).
      By continuously tracking these changes, DNS Coffee uncovers valuable
      trends over time, making it a powerful resource for analysis and research.
      What began in 2011 with just 4 zones has grown into a robust platform that
      now processes data from over 1,200 zones daily.
